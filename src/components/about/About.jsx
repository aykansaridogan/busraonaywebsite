            I have advanced knowledge in MS Office, ISO 9001:2015, and the ÃœTS (Product Tracking System). I
am highly practical and successful in registering medical devices with the Turkish Ministry of Health.
I excel in efficient and independent work, crisis management, effective time management, and
attention to detail. My proficiency in both Turkish and English allows me to communicate effectively
in written and verbal forms at both national and international levels. I am skilled in using MS Office
applications and can successfully manage complex projects with a systematic approach. With my
research-oriented mindset, I closely follow current regulatory changes. My strong communication
and presentation skills boost my confidence in planning and organization. I work with a resultsoriented focus and have developed my skills in reporting and regulation due to my analytical thinking
abilities. Conducting literature reviews has become both a hobby and a means of personal
development for me. What sets me apart is my research-driven spirit and positive energy, which
consistently puts me in the forefront
